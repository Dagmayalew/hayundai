          <p>Marathon Motor Engineering PLC (MME) was founded in 2008 and
            officially inaugurate in February 2009 as importer and distributor
            of Hyundai passenger, commercial vehicles and genuine parts in
            Ethiopia.
            2009 was year of inception to MME and it starts by importing parts
            for existing Hyundai cars, provide services and support current
            owners of Hyundai to earn their confidence and to use their
            reference. On the same time there was a challenge of shortage of
            hard currency. It was the commencement of the global financial
            crisis that led to the economic recession and ultimately created the
            social crisis that changes the lives of millions in number of
            countries. Major institutions that have been successfully in
            business for years, even decades, had started losing revenue,
            downsizing and many of them even closed down. Transactions slowed
            down, businesses shrank, economies crumbled, and families struggled
            to survive.
            
            2010 was year of earning. Despites its brief existence, MME started
            crating a positive image for Hyundai and building a name as a strong
            competitor in the automotive market of the country. Parallel to this
            there were challenges of lack of local market trust. The Ethiopian
            car market has been dictated for decades solely by car brokers and
            also dominated by only one brand. Even if the competition is tougher
            MME starts winning tenders to supply fleets for big government and
            non-government projects.
            
            MME’s commitment, competency and noteworthy success won the
            confidence of Hyundai. After three years of venture with only letter
            of intent, Hyundai granted MME a distributorship of agreement.
            Through diligent and outstanding performance in customer care in
            sells, parts and service MME’s turnover has increased considerably.
            Our target ‘’Bigger, Better and Stronger’’: Bigger investment,
            Better facilities and services, Stronger performance. It reinforced
            mobile workshops, intensive care as well as roadside assistance; it
            laid the foundation of 3S facilities Sells, Spare-parts and
            Services.
            
            MME would like to reassure that the future is more brighter with
            Hyundai’s New Thinking New Possibilities. Hyundai strongly believes
            that its distributors across the globe to be lifetime partners.
            Similarly, MME would like to establish a lifetime partnership with
            its customers.
            
            MME is also exclusive agents of SAME Tractor from Italy Since, 2016
            and we import different type of tractors Explorer3 115, Especial
            Explorer 95 and Laser tractor 130.
            
            On 25th May, 2017 MME signed SKD assembly technical assistance
            agreement with Hyundai motor company. The assembly plant will
            produce 5000 in one shift, and 10,000 at full capacity assorted
            models of cars per year.
